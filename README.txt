Thanks for using this Sudoku Solver! In order to use this program, you will need to convert the sudoku puzzle you wish to have solved into a 9x9 set of cells in a Microsoft Excel file. Then you're ready to run the program. The program will then ask you to select the file that contains the sudoku puzzle that you want solved. 

If you cannot find the puzzle, make sure that you have the file explorer set to All Files, not All Matlab Files. 

Thanks again for using this program!
